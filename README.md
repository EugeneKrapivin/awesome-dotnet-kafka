# Awesome kafka for DotNet resources

The purpose of this page is to organize the resources we find regarding kafka for dotnet.

## Libraries

* [Confluent kafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet) - The official confluent driver for kafka by confluent. Based on top of the [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) C library (like most of the kafka drivers, except Java) provides most of the features for working with Kafka. However, doesn't support advance features like kafka streams.
* [Kafka Flow](https://github.com/Farfetch/kafka-flow) - KafkaFlow is a .NET framework to create Kafka based applications, simple to use and extend.
* [ksqlDB rest client](https://github.com/tomasfabian/ksqlDB.RestApi.Client-DotNet) - This package generates ksql queries from your .NET C# linq queries. You can filter, project, limit, etc. your push notifications server side with ksqlDB push queries. You can continually process computations over unbounded (theoretically never-ending) streams of data. It also allows you to execute SQL statements via the Rest API such as inserting records into streams and creating tables, types, etc. or executing admin operations such as listing streams.
* [kafka streams](https://github.com/LGouellec/kafka-streams-dotnet) - Streamiz Kafka .NET is .NET stream processing library for Apache Kafka.
